## Main idea
This project is trying to provide a template for electron app within react and antd.
By using it,developer can quickly start a new project for electron.

## How to use

- First step: Install the dependencies

```shell
$ yarn install
```

- Second step: Run webpack.

```shell
$ yarn start
```

- Third step: Start electron app.

```shell
$ yarn test
```

- Most important step:  
For now, you get start to develop your own app happily.  
**You are free to use F5 or Ctrl+R to reflash electron app without restart it During your development.**

## Last but not least
After your development (remember to reset the variable inside the `package.json`), you can now package your app.

```shell
$ yarn build
```
