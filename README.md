## Main idea
This project is trying to provide a template for electron app within react and antd.
By using it,developer can quickly start a new project for electron.

## How to use

First step: Install the dependencies

```shell
$ yarn install
```

Second step: Run webpack.

```shell
$ yarn start
```

Third step: Start electron app.

```shell
$ yarn test
```

For now, you get start to develop your own app happily.

## Last but not least
After your development (remember to reset the variable inside the `package.json`), you can now package your app.

```shell
$ yarn build
```
