By using it,developer can quickly start a new project for electron.

## How to use

First step: Install the dependencies

```shell
$ yarn install
```

Second step: Run webpack.

```shell
$ yarn start
```

Third step: Start electron app.

```shell
$ yarn test
```

Most important step:
For now, you get start to develop your own app happily.
**You are free to use F5 or Ctrl+R to reflash electron app without restart it During your development.**

## Last but not least
After your development (remember to reset the variable inside the `package.json`), you can now package your app.

```shell
$ yarn build
```
